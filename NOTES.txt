The idea is to have a shortcut that shows git blame info aligned to the right,
and then some functionality to get deeper info on any given line.

think on all leaders
<leader>ic is close regardless of which mode in
<leader>ib (git blame) - will show git blame for all lines with below info
Then get pane to the left which gives
    color each commit to a unique so that is more obvious what came together
    at what point start rotating colors? - need some color support?

but using <leader>ii, then as go through lines colors all other lines on that commit with more info in the left bar
    diff sized bar on what is happening
    all lines run over if they need to

feat: this is a simple    | <head>
message, but what of more |     <title>Web Page Word Counter</title> lets say this line was hovered over then is highlughted BLUE
complex messages and sub  |     <link href="index.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet"> BLUE
messages?                 | </head> BLUE

exmaple above is when just one commit/move/whatever associated with this code
separate with a ------- ?
if git history is mega long then catch switch to tab scroll down
    use git blame -L
    how use combo of blame and log to see if moved across maybe?

I think first step is just getting the simple first one done me thinks
https://github.com/nvim-neorocks/nvim-best-practices = for lua git blame development

need to keep the new pane in the same window/pane?

renovate json thing?
 add nvim to name somehow or quirkier name for plugin? = the latter?

https://github.com/ellisonleao/nvim-plugin-template =  going off this too
